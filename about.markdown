We have 10 years to reduce our emissions by half, and 30 years to reduce them to zero. Current policies won't get us there. This is about how we're going to get it done.

While a number of countries have committed to goals that sound good in theory, the policies needed to actually achieve them are far from being implemented. While it's important to consider how innovation will can help reduce emissions, history up to this point suggests that technological change will not get us there. We need to commit as a society to policies that will change how we produce and consume.
