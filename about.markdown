We have 10 years to reduce our emissions by half, and 30 years to reduce them to zero. This is about how we're going to get it done.

While a number of countries have committed to goals such as these, so far none have put in place real policies to achieve them. While it's important to consider how technology will help us get there, history up to this point suggests that technological change will not get us there. We need to commit as a society to policies that will change how we produce and consume, and so politics is at the heart of the quest.
